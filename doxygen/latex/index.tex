This is a C library for handling Web\-Socket connections. The library itself is pretty small and it mainly serves to glue together a number of well-\/written C libraries to provide this functionality.

\subsection*{Requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://libevent.org/}{\tt libevent}
\item \href{http://wslay.sourceforge.net/}{\tt wslay}
\item \href{http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/}{\tt nettle}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Install}

\begin{DoxyVerb}./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check # optional
make install
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{A\-P\-I}

The A\-P\-I attempts to closely mirror libevent's A\-P\-I for raw sockets. Complete documentation is \href{http://crunchyfrog.github.io/libevws/doxygen/html/}{\tt here}.

A simple Web\-Socket echo server can be found in the examples directory \href{https://github.com/crunchyfrog/libevws/blob/master/examples/echo_server.c}{\tt here}.

\subsection*{Tests}

The echo server in the examples directory passes all of the \href{http://autobahn.ws/}{\tt Autobahn Web\-Socket Tests}\-: \href{http://crunchyfrog.github.io/libevws/autobahn/}{\tt Results}

There is a small amount of unit testing also included.

\subsection*{Motivation}

This library is intended to be a simple lightweight Web\-Socket server library. It is also intended that it can be easily used in a server that also handles raw sockets (see example \href{https://github.com/crunchyfrog/libevws/blob/master/examples/dual_echo_server.c}{\tt here}) or does lots of other I\-O via libevent.

\subsection*{Status}

This is v0.\-1 of the library so, while tested and used successfully, it has not been battle-\/hardened.

\subsection*{Possible T\-O\-D\-Os}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\-S\-L support
\item Server initiated pings (the server does already correctly reply to all pings received)
\item Improve efficiency by eliminating bufferevent 
\end{DoxyItemize}
